### Understanding `rsyslog`

`rsyslog` is the logging daemon for the system. It is responsible for collecting and storing log messages generated by the kernel and various system services.

You can locate `rsyslog` using the `locate` command:
```bash
locate rsyslog
```

The configuration file for `rsyslog` can be found in the `/etc` directory, allowing you to modify it if necessary.

### Log Priority Levels

Here are the priority levels for logs, listed from low to high:

1. **debug**
2. **info**
3. **notice**
4. **warning**
5. **warn**
6. **error**
7. **err**
8. **crit**
9. **alert**
10. **emerg**
11. **panic**

### Managing Logs with `logrotate`

Logs can be automatically cleaned and managed with the `logrotate` program. 

**Example Output of `logrotate.conf`:**
```bash
┌─[chris@parrot]─[/var/log]
└──╼ $ cat /etc/logrotate.conf
# see "man logrotate" for details

# global options do not affect preceding include directives

# rotate log files weekly
weekly

# keep 4 weeks worth of backlogs
rotate 4

# create new (empty) log files after rotating old ones
create

# use date as a suffix of the rotated file
#dateext

# uncomment this if you want your log files compressed
#compress

# packages drop log rotation information into this directory
include /etc/logrotate.d

# system-specific logs may also be configured here.
```

### Secure Log File Deletion

To make a log file completely unreadable and unrecoverable, use the `shred` command:
```bash
shred -f -n 10 <path_to_log_file>.*
```
- **-f**: Force overwriting.
- **-n 10**: Overwrite the file 10 times to ensure it cannot be recovered.

### Stopping `rsyslog`

You can disable logging by stopping the `rsyslog` service:
```bash
service rsyslog stop
```
**Note:** This is not recommended for your own system, as it will prevent logging of important events. However, on a target system, this could be useful to avoid leaving traces of your activities.

### Additional Tips

- **Viewing Logs**: Use `cat`, `less`, or `tail` to read log files in the `/var/log` directory.
  ```bash
  cat /var/log/syslog
  tail -f /var/log/auth.log
  ```
- **Restarting `rsyslog`**: If you need to restart the logging service after making changes, use:
  ```bash
  service rsyslog restart
  ```
